        <h4>Problems to solve</h4>
        <p>As someone who has a Gluten free restricted diet, I often faced problems of finding new gluten free food products, recipes and restaurants. Therefore, I design an app which could solve these problems: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Discovery of new Gluten Free food products</li>
          <li>Gluten Free recipes </li>
          <li>Gluten Free restaurants</li>
        </ol> 
        <hr>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <h5>Market Research</h5>
        <p>I carried out some desktop research to discover whether there was any apps currently available on the market, which were similar to the one I intended to make. Through searching app stores and websites, I discovered an app ‘Find me Gluten Free’ which has been developed for users to find gluten free friendly restaurants. I also researched broader terms including ‘food apps’, ‘recipe apps’ and ‘restaurant finder apps’ which allowed me to discover a vast range of apps designed to solve similar problems.</p>
        <p>With each of the apps I discovered, I downloaded, tested a read reviews to build my knowledge of the aims and pain points of users.</p>
        <p>Apps I reviewed included: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vegan Maps</li>
          <li>Simple Vegan: Recipes and Guides</li>
          <li>Meals - Healthy meal planner</li>
        </ul>
