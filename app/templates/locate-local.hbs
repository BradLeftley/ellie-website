        <h4><b>The challenge</b></h4>
        <p>Throughout the global pandemic, there has been continued encouragement to support local businesses. However, it can sometimes be difficult to identify businesses that operate in the local area, especially online businesses. When searching for local businesses there can often be a few issues: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information is spread across different platforms (e.g. online directories, local social media pages)</li>
          <li>Business directories often only have contact information and do not show much business information or product images</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I decided to explore whether these were common issues that others experienced and if so, how I could potentially solve these issues.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4><b>Research</b></h4>
        <h5>Desktop research</h5>
        <p>I began my desktop research by reviewing a variety of sources where business local to my area promote their products and services. This included business directories, local community webpages and local social media groups.</p>
<p>When reviewing these online platforms my aim was to explore how easily and efficiently I could find particular business. I gave myself a number of services and products to search for locally. I used the below questions to guide this research:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Can I firstly find the product and/or service that I’m looking for?</li>
  <li>Am I able view images of the product and/or service on that platform?</li>
  <li>How easily can I navigate to find the product/service? What errors am I making?</li>
</ol>
        <h5>Interviews</h5>
        <p>Alongside my desktop research, I interviewed both local community members as well as local business owners. Throughout my interviews, my aim was to explore if they too experienced the same challenges when finding/promoting locals businesses online, and if so, did they have similar pain points to the ones I myself found. </p>
        <p>Some of the questions I asked included:</p>
        <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Community members</th>
    <th>Local business oweners</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 1. How do you find out about local businesses? </td>
    <td> 1. How do you promote your business online?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 2. Do you find any challenges when searching for local businesses online? If yes, please can you describe these challenges. </td>
    <td> 2. With the methods you use to promote your business online, what are some of the positive aspects and what are some of the challenges? </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<h5>Results</h5>
<p>From the results of my desktop research and interviews with local community members and business owners, I was able to identify the commonly used online platforms used by both to search and promote online businesses. These included social media pages, online business directories, business websites and local community webpages.</p>
<p>The interviews provided valuable information on the benefits and drawbacks of these platforms from the audiences perspectives. To to help make sense of my interview findings, I grouped common findings through the tool of an affinity map. </p>

  <p></p>
   <h5>Critical problems identified</h5>
   <ol>
  <li>Difficultly in finding information on local business through online sources as product and service information is inconsistent over a variety of sources</li>
  <li>Commonly used platforms identified did had varied rates of conversions to purchase</li>
</ol>

<h4><b>Problem solving through design</b></h4>
<h5>Personas</h5>
<p>Before moving on the ideation phase to develop a solution, I created audience personas based on my research. This allowed me to identify common behaviours, goals, expectations and problems. This ultimately informs me who I will be designing for.</p>
<p>

</div>
</p>
<h5>Ideation</h5>
<p>Based on the needs and goals of my users, I created a user flow to identify what information would need to be presented or interacted with by the user at each stage of the user's journey.</p> 
<p>I experimented with different user flows to produce one which would be most effective to complete the user’s task. Throughout the iterative process, I tested different flows with users to identify the one which would allow the completion of the task most effectively and efficiently. I did this through showing users high-fidelity designs which I created in Figma. Creating a high-fidelity design at this stage, allowed me to gain richer insights into the errors users were making in the different flows. This was essential to help develop red routes and thus identifying the optimum user flow.</p>

<p>One key iteration that occurred through the user tests was ensure the final product page was one that would optimise conversions to the company website - this was a key goal of both the user and business owners. I found through the user testing, user's were unsure what action to take next once they had reached the product page. For example, many found the contact information on the product page and explained that from there, may call or ‘google’ the company to purchase the product and/or service. 
To ensure this page led to conversions, I built in clear key buttons which would direct the user to the company’s webpages with ease. When testing this feature with users again, it proved to reduce confusion and increased click throughs to the company website. </p>

        <h4><b>The outcome</b></h4>
<h5>Final design</h5>

<h5>Reflection</h5>
<p>From my final user testing, it is evident that the web based solution I have created will enable users to effectively and efficiently locate businesses local to them as well as convert browsers to click throughs to company websites - achieving goals for both the user and business owner.</p> 
<p>To further develop this design, I would like to enable business owners to customise their product page to reflect their business and to also incorporate purchasing through the website. This will prevent users being directed from the website which increases the risk of drop off and thus conversions.</p>
