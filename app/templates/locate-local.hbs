        <h4><b>The challenge</b></h4>
        <p>Throughout the global pandemic, there has been continued encouragement to support local businesses. Over the last year, I have also been looking to shop local however, when searching for businesses which could serve my needs, I found a few issues: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information is spread across different platforms (e.g. online directories, local social media pages)</li>
          <li>Business directories often only have contact information and do not show much business information or product images</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I decided to explore whether these were common issues that others experienced and if so, how I could potentially solve these issues.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4><b>Research</b></h4>
        <h5>Desktop research</h5>
        <p>I began my investigation by carrying out desktop research. Across different mediums; books, magazines, websites and apps, I searched to find whether a solution to my problem currently exists in the market.</p>
        <p>I searched in local grocery stores, online and through app stores including IOS app store and Android app store. Search terms included ‘gluten ree’, 'restaurants', 'recipes', ‘food apps’, ‘recipe apps’ and ‘restaurant finder apps’. </p>
        <p>With each source of information, I read reviews to further understand the aims of readers and users and also to discover where perhaps it did not meet their expectations.</p>
        <p>From my desktop research, I found that different mediums each gave specific information into one or more areas I was searching for; recipes, restaurants and food supplies. However, there was not one medium that acted as a sole host of all this information.</p>
        <p>Apps I reviewed included: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gluten free heaven</li>
          <li>How to be Gluten free and keep your friends </li>
          <li>Simple Vegan: Recipes and Guides</li>
          <li>Find Me Gluten Free</li>
          <li>Meals - Healthy meal planner</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="center-container">
        <img src="assets/images/appscreenshotone.png" alt="App screenshotone" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
        <img src="assets/images/applescreenshottwo.png" alt="App screenshottwo" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
        </div>

        <h5>Interviews</h5>
        <p>Following on from the desktop research, I wanted to confirm whether the problem was one that was a common experience for others. To do so I carried out qualitative research in the form of interviews, on individuals who follow a Gluten Free diet. My aim was to understand and identify the needs of those who follow a gluten free diet as well as some of their challenges.</p>
        <p>Some of the questions used in the interviews included:</p>
        <ol>
  <li>What are your reasons for following a Gluten Free diet?</li>
  <li>What do you enjoy most about following a Gluten Free diet? </li>
  <li>What do you find most difficult about following a Gluten Free diet?</li>
</ol>
<p>To help make sense of my interview findings, I grouped common problems through the tool of an affinity map. From this exercise, I was able to identify two key problems which had the greatest impact on the majority of those who I interviewed.</p>
<p>

</div>
</p>   
   <h5>Critical problems identified</h5>
   <ol>
  <li><b>It takes too long to find information</b> - the majority of interviewees mentioned that they found it time consuming searching across various platforms to find gluten free recipes, products and restaurants </li>
  <li><b>There are many varied sources of information to navigate</b> - much of the information from a particular source, was often specialised in one area. For example most books and magazines focused on home cooking recipes but paid little attention in describing where to source ingredients. </li>
</ol>

<h5>Personas</h5>
<p>Before moving on the ideation phase to develop a solution, I created audience personas based on my research. This allowed me to identify common behaviours, goals, expectations and problems. This ultimately informs me who I will be designing for.</p>

<h4><b>Problem solving through design</b></h4>
<p>Based on the needs and goals of my audience, I decided to create an app based solution which would be a single source of information on gluten free food products, recipes and restaurants. Creating this on an application platform will allow users to access information, easily, quickly and whilst on the move - something which would contribute to solving a key problem; the time take it takes to access information.</p>
<p>Following this decision, I sketched out the user journey through defining; user, task and goal.</p>
<p>
  <div class="center-container">
    <img src="assets/images/6 2.png" alt="User flow 1" style="width:275px;height:200px;">
    <img src="assets/images/7.png" alt="User flow 2" style="width:250px;height:235px;"> 
  </div>
</p>
<p>I experimented with different designs and flows, receiving feedback from users throughout. I continued to iterate on my design discussing with potential users demonstrating the red routes of the application and got the users to carry out different user flows. Through A/B testing on two separate flows, I was able to identify which flow allowed users to achieve their goals most effectively and efficiently. This was one which had a reduced number of screens allowing the user to achieve their aims more efficiently. </p>
<p>I then created a high fidelity design using Figma which I continued to receive feedback on and iterated. </p>
<p>One key aspect that prove important at this stage were within the branding for the app. After receiving feedback, I looked to the market for visual references, for example the identifiable gluten free symbol, which would influence my design. These elements are important within the design as the gluten free symbol for example, is recognised by all gluten free diet followers and based on their knowledge and experience of the world, would allow them to begin to understand the function of the app just through visual cues.</p>

        <h4><b>The outcome</b></h4>
<h5>Final design</h5>
  <div class="center-container">

    <img src="assets/images/final 2.png" alt="App 2" style="width:175px;height:325px;"> 
    <img src="assets/images/final 3.png" alt="App 3" style="width:175px;height:325px;"> </p>
    <p><img src="assets/images/final 4.png" alt="App 4" style="width:175px;height:325px;"> 
    <img src="assets/images/final 5.png" alt="App 5" style="width:175px;height:325px;"> 
    <img src="assets/images/final 6.png" alt="App 6" style="width:175px;height:325px;"> </p>
    <p><img src="assets/images/final 7.png" alt="App 7" style="width:175px;height:325px;"> 
    <img src="assets/images/final 8.png" alt="App 8" style="width:175px;height:325px;"> 
    <img src="assets/images/final 9.png" alt="App 9" style="width:175px;height:325px;"> 
  </p>
</div>

<h5>Reflection</h5>
<p>Creating one single source of information on an application platform, where users are able to find gluten free restaurants, food items and recipes with ease, solves the critical key problems faced by users. </p> 
<p>However, developing this solution challenged me to ensure my visual design was one which users could bring previous knowledge and memory to. This ultimately helps prevent the occurrences of user errors.</p> 
<p>To further develop this design, I would like to encompass purchasing functions within the app. This would allow users to add items to a basket and purchase directly from the stores. Additionally, I believe it would be valuable to add a meal planner function, linking to purchasing the food items allowing users to complete all desired tasks in one place.</p>
